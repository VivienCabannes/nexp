# Neural Networks Experiments

This repository aims at providing simple functions to easily try out new ideas related to deep learning.

## Installation
`Nexp` is based on pytorch with GPU support. Pytorch should be installed first.
See [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) for a full list of dependent packages.

TODO: Installation through pip, should be put in pypi at the end.

## Quickstart

- [DONE] Train CIFAR on one GPU
- [DONE] Train CIFAR on several GPUs

- Do it in SSL mode

- Look at classification results with SSL full graph

- Do it with checkpoints.

- Incorporate fast data loaders such as FFCV or NVIDIA-DALI
- Add profiler to find ideal batch-size, for each model

#### Deal with datasets
Vision: ImageNet, MNIST

#### Try
