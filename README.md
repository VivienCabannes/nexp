# Neural Networks Experiments

This repository aims at providing simple functions to easily try out new ideas related to deep learning.

## Installation
`Nexp` is based on pytorch with GPU support. Pytorch should be installed first.
See [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) for a full list of dependent packages.

TODO: Installation through pip, should be put in pypi at the end.
