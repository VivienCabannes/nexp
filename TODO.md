## Quickstart
- [DONE] Train CIFAR on one GPU
- [DONE] Train CIFAR on several GPUs
- [DONE] Add logging 
- [DONE] Run it on SLURM

- Add checkpoints
- Run it with submitit

- Do it in SSL mode
- Look at classification results with SSL full graph

- Incorporate fast data loaders such as FFCV or NVIDIA-DALI
- Add profiler to find ideal batch-size, for each model
